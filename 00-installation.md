# Let's get it started then!

Welcome to python-getstarted, the ultimate guide which helps you become a Python master!

# Chapter 0: Installation

Obviously, you need to download Python. To do that, head over to [the official downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
and choose the appropriate python for your OS. This tutorial will focus on Windows users, since most people use that.

## The installation procedure

As of the time of this writing, Python 3.7.3 is the latest version. After you've downloaded the file (exe),
open it and you should see something like this:

> Note: 32-bit editions and 64-bit editions are technically the same, it's OK to install a 32-bit version a 64-bit machine.

Now, click the "Install Now" button and wait for the process to finish.

Great job, you got Python! :tada: 

## Choosing an IDE

IDE means Integrated Development Environment. It's basically a text editor, but you write code in it.
IDEs "integrate" with the programming language and try to help you in any way possible.  
Also, they looks cool. :sunglasses:

### Python recommended IDE: IDLE

Python comes with a built-in "IDE". It's a bit old, but gets the job done if you're not too keen on looks.
It has two windows, a console and an editor (see below). It has basic syntax highlighting and checking, 
and a very basic autocomplete, which doesn't always work.

### Recommended IDE by me: Visual Studio Code

Microsoft has built a pretty cool IDE, called Visual Studio Code (or vscode for short), which has been the Swiss Army Knife
for developers of all kinds in the last couple years.

It has lots of plugins to support your language of choice, and the Python one is just... flawless.
Advanced autocomplete (with complete documentation), syntax highlighting and checking, debugging on-demand,
online collaboration (think Google Docs) do I need to say more?

Just give it a try! Get it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) now!  
I'm even writing this documentation in it!

> Note: I am not affiliated with Microsoft. I just like this editor :D
